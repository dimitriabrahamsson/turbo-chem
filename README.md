## Welcome to TurboChem!
### TurboChem is an in silico structure prediction algorithm designed to propose molecular structures for chemical features detected  in non-targeted analysis with high-resolution mass spectrometry
#### TurboChem is based on the idea that different molecular structures have distinctly different physicochemical properties and when these properties are put together they form a unique fingerpring - a "physicochemical fingerprint".

TurboChem so far has 2 versions. Version 1.0 was released as part of the study "In Silico Structure Predictions for Non-targeted Analysis: From Physicochemical Properties to Molecular Structures" published in JASMS. Version 2.0 is the latest version of the package and is part of the most recent paper "Extracting structural information from physicochemical properties using machine learning - A new approach in structure elucidation for non-targeted analysis." 

Look under folders TurboChem 1.0 and TurboChem 2.0 for instructions on how to use each version
